# Sixth Sense

## Implementation
1. Run without fall detection
   - just provide power through usbC port on ESP32. We used a power bank.
3. run the sixthsense.ino file for the ESP32 code.
   - this controls the servo motor, ultrasonic sensor and DC motor.
   - allows you to edit the code using Arduino IDE.
   - Running just this does not implement fall detection
     
4. Run with fall detection
   - provide power to the ESP32 and run the python script in the sixthsense folder.

**Enjoy! We had a wonderful time at Hack The North!**
